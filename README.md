# Seattle-Buildings-Energy-Benchmarking

Anticipation of energy consumption of Seattle buildings :

- Prediction of energy consumption and CO2 emmissions using ML algorithms
- Evaluating the interest of ENERGY STAR SCORE for the prediction

1/ Notebook 1 : Explaratory Data Analysis

- Cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Data Visualisation using folium.Choropleth
- Descriptive analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Data transformations

2/ Notebook 2 : Modeling

- Evaluating models
> Linear Regression

> Decision trees

> Random Forests

- Cross-validation
- Residual Analysis
- Fine-tuning of final models 
> Regression Ridge 
> Regression Lasso
> Elastic Net
> Consideration of use of bagging
> Fine-tuning de random forests

- Evaluation of ENERGY STAR SCORE feature
